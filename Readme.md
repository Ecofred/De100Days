# Days

## Day 4 (next, 2.1)

## Day 3 (1.3)

Download SSMS & install sql server

let's go the docker way! Set in a ps1 script, database with .sql in the `d2` & `sql` folder


## DAY 1 (1.1)

1. What do you hope to accomplish by the end of the 100 days?
    
    Discover new tool and cool way to orchestrate and transform
    data pipeline

1. Are there any topics you'd like to learn that aren't covered?

    Not much, i'm here for the content, and that's it

1. What is the most complex SQL problem you have solved? Could you have solved it an easier way?

    some `OUTER APPLY` stuff or `WINDOW`, `WITH`. Maybe dealing with *Gap and Island* alike problem

1. What do you understand about data modeling and data storage paradigms? Do you understand concepts such as normalization, denormalization, slowly changing dimensions, etc?
    - Data Modeling: Quite deep in the Normal Forms (down to 6th), Star schema and denorm, not much yet
    - Data storage paradigms: Huuuuh wut?
    - Slowly changing dimensions: yeah but not that deep in it as of now 


1. Do you understand the basics of programming, loops, conditionals, classes, etc? What are some of the most challenging problems you had to solve at work and what made them challenging

    - I like to think so, I had fun with recursion and monads once
    - Most challenging: find a way to missuse SAS to product nicely down pdf, or move from Access to F#/SqlServer
